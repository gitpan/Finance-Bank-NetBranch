Revision history for Finance-Bank-NetBranch

0.01    2006-06-13T23:00:00-0500
		First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    2006-06-14T23:06:50-0500
		Cleaned up some POD, added support for getting transaction history.
		Currently, every action requires a login and a logout, now performed by
		private helpers; I would like to see a way to handle the session
		timeout and login only when necessary.

0.03	2006-06-15T12:30:00-0500
		Fixed silly bug in regular expression parsing of balances that would
		have failed for negative numbers; added "non-greedy" attribute to some
		regex atoms in transaction parser (not really necessary, but slightly
		safer and parallel with balance parser). Made method PODs parallel
		throughout.

0.04	2006-06-16T10:46:05-0500
		I think this fixes the Test::Pod::Coverage test breakage.

0.05	2006-06-18T17:52:35-0500
		Bothered to read the test failure report and realized I hadn't covered
		pad0() and that my POD was broken. If I would just get
		Test::Pod::Coverage and Test::Pod installed on this machine, I suppose
		this might not happen.
