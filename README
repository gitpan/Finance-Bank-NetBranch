Finance-Bank-NetBranch

This README describes Finance::Bank::NetBranch version 0.06; documentation
following is a brief summary of the module POD, and is possibly stale. Reading
the module's POD is recommended.

This module allows you to manage your NetBranch accounts with Perl; currently,
that means you can check your balances and transaction history, but in the
future it might mean you can transfer money between accounts or do other fancy
things.

This module was originally implemented to interface with Valley Communities
Credit Union's page at C<https://nbp1.cunetbranch.com/valley/>, but the
behavior of the module is theoretically generalized to "NetBranch" type online
access.  However, I do not have access to another NetBranch account with
another bank, and so any feedback on the actual behavior of this module would
be greatly appreciated.
